# Best Postman Alternative

No, it's not Insomnia. In fact, this instrument is not even an app, it's just a VS Code extension. The extension is called HttpYac, and it is a file-based tool. So you can just create a `.http` file, send a request, and maybe even commit the file without ever leaving VS Code. The tool is powerful and fun to use, but learning it can be quite a twisted journey. So, let me guide you through!

> I feel the tool gives the most for coders. If you just starting your IT journey the tool may be an overkill. But feel free to come back once you are tired of standard, inefficient apps.

## Getting Started

I'll assume you have [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed. 

## CLI

| Output    | Gives You                       |
|-----------|---------------------------------|
| short     | Method, Url -> Status, Elapsed  |
| body      | Just Response Body              |
| headers   | Request and Response Headers    |
| response  | Response Headers and Body       |
| exchange  | All Headers and Body            |
| none      | Just how many requests processed |

## Wrapping Up

Although we've seen a lot of cool things HttpYac can do, the article didn't cover a bunch of other features. For example, httpyac supports:

- GraphQL
- GRPC
- RabbitMQ (yes, even this!)
- Assertions
- Node JS Scripting

And there's probably something else, so I encourage you to check out the [project page](https://httpyac.github.io/) to find out what else you can achieve. And, by the way ...claps for the article are also appreciated ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘ˆ
